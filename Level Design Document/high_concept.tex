\section{High Concept}

\subsection{Game}

This is a single player adventure game, mainly focused on storytelling, exploration and real time combat. The player's avatar is a twisted version of the
main character of Stranger Things: Eleven. This copy has the same memories as the original, so at the starting point they are identical.
The game has, in addition to the main combat system, two main features:

\begin{itemize}
	\item After a certain level, you can use demons to explore new areas that can only be reached through a mini-game.
	\item During the adventure, the player will be accompanied by several NPCs who will be able to give active and passive support.
\end{itemize}

Lastly, during boss battles, it will be possible to interact with some elements of the map that can change the flow of the fight, such as giving buffs, malus or damage.

\subsection{Story}
The story stars BAD Eleven, a copy of Eleven, looking for a way to leave the Upside Down. After learning the basic techniques of survival from a mysterious man named Kyle, Elby will undertake a journey in search of the Numbers, people on whom experiments have been conducted, just like his original counterpart. Each of these people has special abilities, which led them to have different survival methods and goals. They will therefore be described the rules behind the Upside Down and the events that will lead it to a radical change.
