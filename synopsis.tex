\section{Synopsis}

The death of the DemoGorgon, killed by Eleven, starts a paradox that, in addition to carrying the girl in the Upside-down, generates a reincarnation of 
the demon in the form of El herself, called B.A.D. Eleven (Biological Altered Demon \#011), having the same memories and abilities as the original.

\subsection{Act I}
BAD Eleven (Elby for short) wakes up in Hawkins school, confused and scared. Wandering through the building, he sees Eleven escaping through a portal, 
but later, after trying to get in, discovers that she can't cross it. After having faced a Demon generated by the remains of Barbara's body in the library, she meets in the courtyard Blank, a survivor of the Upside-Down, who leads her to his shelter. Here, after having taught her the basics of survival, he suggests that she should go to the laboratory to escape from the Upside-Down through the portal opened by Eleven. Elby then walks towards the structure, but once she reaches the gap, she again fails to cross it. While heading for the exit,she finds the data and photos of projects \#003, \#005 and \#009. Back at the shelter, she uses her telekinesis to locate the three numbers and decides to go looking for \#005, while Blank will meet \#003.\\

Elby and \#005 return to the shelter, where he begins to become suspicious of the identity of Blank. Having no further clues about the portal 
crossing method, they decide to leave for Dallas to meet \#009. Meanwhile Blank managed to find \#003.

\subsection{Act II}
\{To be defined\} (Arrival in Dallas, Introduction of \#009 and \#010, Reveal of Blank into \#001, Abduction of \#005)\\

Reached the Upside-Down Core, Elby and \#010 are captured by \#001 and assist while he kills \#005 and extracts its powers through the use of a parasite. 
Having now both the biocynesis and the mental synchronization with the demons, \#001 is able to take control of the Core and use its chronocynesis at will.
Threatening to kill \#010, he forces Elby to open a portal, thus completing his plan to return home in the time instant he craves. However, it is revealed
that this is another alternative reality, and that it is therefore impossible to recreate the conditions to have the correct time and space. This causes a 
psychological breakdown in \#001, which kills \#010 and uses its powers to create a giant creature for the purpose of transporting the Core and expanding 
the Upside-Down to all realities, starting with that he came from.

\subsection{Act III}
\{To be defined\} (Dallas Resistance, Creature Defeat, Final Battle)\\

After the final battle, which foresees the death of all the surviving numbers, it is possible to see the Upside-Down Core, still active, while incorporating
the corpses of \#001 and BAD \#011. This causes a mutation in the creature, which takes shape of a giant spider and becomes a sentient entity, later called 
Mind Flayer. Reference is therefore made to the will of the demon to invade other dimensions (influence of \#001) and to the hatred it feels towards Eleven 
(influence of BAD \#011), characteristics seen in the Second and Third Season.
