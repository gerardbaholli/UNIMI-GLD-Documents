\section{Data Storage and Access}
\textbf{Data Manager:} Gerard Baholli\\
The shared data are hosted in a remote repository on GitHub. The data is also constantly synchronized through the Google Drive synchronization and backup service. Moreover, the data are pushed in the remote repository at the end of each day. For new members who need to access data shared by project members, write to \texttt{gerardbaholli@live.it}.

\subsection{Backup}
Data is backed up on a Google Drive shared folder, every Friday evening between 18:00 and 18:30. For each back up a folder is created with today's date as name: \textit{YYYY\_MM\_AA}.\\
This ensures us a backup version every week.
