\section{Data Types and Format}

\subsection{Text}
The document is written in \LaTeX\ so all the new chapters inserted in the document must be written in a \textit{.tex} file and then be included in the \textit{main.tex}. Keep in mind that all the formatting rules are contained in the main.tex so if you want to create new documents make a copy of the main.tex file and start from that. Documents that act as a draft can be written in .txt or .md format.

\subsection{Pictures}
Different formats are allowed for the images to be uploaded, but in some cases it's important to respect the dimensions contained below:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}[c]{| p{8cm} | p{3cm} | p{3cm} |}
		\hline
		\textbf{Use} & \textbf{Format}  & \textbf{Info}\\
		\hline
		Reference Images & .png .jpeg & 256 dpi or more \\
		\hline
		Character Icons & .png & 70x70 px\\
		\hline
		Circumplex & .png & 600x600 px \\
		\hline
		Maps of relations & .png & 600x600 px \\
		\hline
		Vector Graphics & .sketch & - \\
		\hline
		Draw.io files & .png (export) & - \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Sounds}
For soundtracks and sound effects of the levels, adopt the .mp3 format at 128 Kbps.

\subsection{Diagrams}
The diagrams were drawn by draw.io, for any change, go to Google Drive and edit directly the source diagram contained in it, at the end export the diagram according to the rules contained in paragraph 2.2. If you want to add new diagrams, use draw.io and export them according to the rules described in paragraph 2.2, rename it according to the rules contained in chapter 5 and insert it in the appropriate folder according to the rules of chapter 4.

\subsection{3D Models}
For 3D models use the FBX format. Autodesk update their FBX installer regularly and it can provide different results with different versions of their own software and other 3rd party 3D apps. If you have any issues you can revert to 2012.2 if necessary.
